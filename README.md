# Conure
A small, dynamically-typed, object-oriented scripting language written in C that takes inspiration from Python, JS, and Ruby.
Visit `docs/info.md` for a tour of the language features (`docs/grammar.cfg` for context-free grammar)<br/>
**Contributions are welcome!** (check `CONTRIBUTING.md`)<br/>
<br/>
(Default compile scripts require [GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org)/[LLVM](http://llvm.org) (these can also be ran on Windows using [Bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/)))<br/>
(Will migrate to [CMake](https://cmake.org) if this language gets bigger)
